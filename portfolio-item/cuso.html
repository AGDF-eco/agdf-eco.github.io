        A green economy is defined by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2014) as “one that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.” Cross River State views a green economy as one that has the potential to secure human well-being through reduction in environmental degradation and ecological scarcities while enhancing social equity. With some 70% of people around the world, particularly in developing countries, depending on natural resources for their livelihoods, environmental risks render them vulnerable to social, economic and environmental crises. The rapid rate of natural resource degradation in Nigeria1, and in Cross River State (CRS) in particular, demands a response focused on a sustainable environmental approaches that also serves to reduce poverty by expanding opportunities for increased income from decent and equitable jobs.

        The concept of a green economy centers on integrating key aspects of economic and social performance—such as poverty reduction, job creation, and social inclusion—with those of environmental performance. The tenet of a green economy is that growth and development are driven by integrated social, ecological, and economic sustainability objectives which are socially inclusive of participation by marginal groups (such as minorities, poor households, youths, women, and the disabled). Women play a key role in food production and form a large proportion of the agricultural work force globally. Given equal resources, women could contribute much more. FAO estimates that if women farmers had the same access as men, agricultural output in 34 developing countries would rise by an estimated average of up to 4%. This could reduce the number of undernourished people in those countries by as much as 17%, translating to up about 150 million fewer hungry people, creating more jobs, and improving the economy. The onus therefore lies on both developed and developing countries to shift to a more sustainable and encompassing economy, by effectively incorporating social, ecological, and economic policies in development planning.

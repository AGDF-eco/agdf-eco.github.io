      <h3>Project involved an AGDF partner</h3>
      <p>
        As a Party to the Paris Agreement of 2015, Nigeria committed to reducing its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, submitting an ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in the run-up to the Paris Climate Conference in 2015. In 2007, Nigeria had elaborated a bold national economic plan– ‘Vision 2020’ – which set out a commitment to rapid economic growth and ambition for the country to become one of the 20 largest economies in the world by 2020. The current administration adopted ‘Vision 2020’, along with an Economic Recovery Growth Plan (ERGP). Together, these provided a road map for Nigeria’s medium to long-term economic development plan.

        With the end of the first cycle of the NDC and the launch of a process for NDC revision, this article analyses the extent of the implementation of the original NDC and also looks at the ambition and intent of the revised NDC. We advocate the establishment of an NDC implementation index, with clear monitoring and tracking tools to be coordinated by a Just Transition Taskforce (JTT) so as to enable the government and the Nigerian public at large to monitor and assess NDC implementation going forward.
